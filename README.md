# ComputerArchitecture-2017
This project was completed under the requirements of the course 'Computer Architecture', 
taught in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at AUTH. 
A program written in Assembly that performs Matrix Multiplication was required in Exercise I. 
The second exercise asked us to perform some tasks using the MIPS simulator.
